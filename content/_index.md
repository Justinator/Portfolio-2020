    - copy: Justin went above and beyond, he traveled 100 miles to have a face to face consultation with me. He put together a website that fit our studio and really showcased what we are about. As an artist, we are not the easiest to work with as we have a vision of what we want. Justin worked with us and we are extremely happy with the results.
